# Mini-Project
This is a mini-project where I built a Travel Guide Website to help users plan trips easily.
It includes options for booking tickets, hotel rooms, and carpooling services, along with a basic admin section for managing activities.

 ✈️ Book Travel Tickets (flights, trains, buses).
 🏨 Book Hotel Rooms (redirects to booking platforms).
 🚗 Carpooling Services (redirects to Zoomcar).
 👤 User Authentication (login/signup using Local Storage).
 🛠️ Admin Section (for managing users/bookings manually).
 🖥️ Responsive Design (works on desktop and mobile).
